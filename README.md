# Coding Fun!
 A series of experimental projects, bundled together in one nice messy package. At least half the projects are incomplete or non-functional.

### Notable Projects
THe following projects are in a working state, and mildly interesting
* Raycasting 2D (Top-down recastin)
* Basic 15 Puzzle
* Raycasting w/o textures (First person)

### Needs  Rework
I would like to revisit the following projects to complete or polish them:
* 2020-05-11-basic-15-puzzle -- Add more features
* 2020-05-11-tennis-thing -- Fix the hit detection edge-cases
* 2020-05-24-bubble-sort-animation -- Add other sort algorithms, plus sound
* 2020-05-25-raycasting-no-textures -- Add textures

### Future Projects
Projects that I may or may not code in the future.
* use matter.js to create a bouncy wheel game
* make a wolfenstein style clone, but in the map editor allow placement of light sources that will be baked into ray-traced lighting for the level.
* a purely prime-factor based number system. An exploration for what that even mean. prime factors baked into the symbology itself
* a viewer to explore large images like Google Maps (scroll to zoom, drag to pan)
* animated julia set fractal viewer. Loops with perlin noise? Full screen 1080p
* cellular automata
* rook's tour puzzle game
* Collision with random number of balls
* Card game: War
* Dice War, Risk-style with 5 dice
* Saving to an external file
* Perlin noise top-down game, when tiles are open vs. walls if noise value is above a threshold. Water if below. Pre-generate the terrain into a 2D array.
* Falling block game. Click a group of 3+ adjacent blocks of the same color for them to dissapear. The blocks above them fall. Extra points for larger groups of blocks
