# coding fun
 A series of experimental projects, bundled together in one nice messy package. At least half the projects are incomplete or non-functional.

# notable projects

I'm going to currate a list of the more interesting projects here:

# future projects
Projects that I may or may not code in the future.
- use matter.js to create a bouncy wheel game
- make a wolfenstein style clone, but in the map editor allow placement of light sources that will be baked into ray-traced lighting for the level.
- a purely prime-factor based number system.
-- an exploration for what that even means
-- prime factors baked into the symbology itself
-- a viewer to explore large images like Google Maps (scroll to zoom, drag to pan)
-- animated julia set fractal viewer. Loops with perlin noise? Full screen 1080p

Another idea list that I found from an old list
- Collision with random number of balls
- Card game: War
- Dice War, Risk-style with 5 dice
- Saving to an external file
- Perlin noise top-down game, when tiles are open vs. walls if noise value is above a threshold. Water if below. Pre-generate the terrain into a 2D array.
- Falling block game. Click a group of 3+ adjacent blocks of the same color for them to dissapear. The blocks above them fall. Extra points for larger groups of blocks
